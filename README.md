# Software-Codes

Project (Website) TextBuddy:

TextBuddy is a website for College Students who might not be able to afford new textbooks, need support in class,
and want a community where they can discuss homework and receive help.

This platform provides students with connections to others with similar needs in a place that allows students to
receive and give help through class forums.

Unlike Craigslist, TextBuddy is geared specifically towards students to meet their similar financial and academic needs.

TextBuddy includes a listings page where students can post listings for selling textbooks or notebooks and other students
can find what recources are accessible and up for sale.

This website also provides a Forum page in which customers can post and reply to discussion posts so that they can converse
with their classmates about difficult topics or course material.

How to build/run/test/etc code: 
We build the code little by little in our IDE(Atom,VS) and use Teletype while collaboration, started with writing codes from one feature to another feature. Then we run codes on Localhost, change codes together, and update GitHub timely. Also, we do test on our device too. We built test cases to outline procedures that we would use to make sure our code was working based on requirements and to improve our codes.
