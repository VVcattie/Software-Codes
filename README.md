Project (Website) TextBuddy:

TextBuddy is a website for College Students who might not be able to afford new textbooks, need support in class,
and want a community where they can discuss homework and receive help.

This platform provides students with connections to others with similar needs in a place that allows students to
receive and give help through class forums.

Unlike Craigslist, TextBuddy is geared specifically towards students to meet their similar financial and academic needs.

TextBuddy includes a listings page where students can post listings for selling textbooks or notebooks and other students
can find what recources are accessible and up for sale.

This website also provides a forum page in which customers can post and reply to discussion posts, so that they can converse
with their classmates about course material or specific topics.

How to build/run/test/etc code: 
The code was built bit by bit, from feature to feature, in Atom,VS, or Sublime. On top of that, one could collaborate with Teletype when using Atom. The code was first tested on Localhost. Then, changes to the code in a timely manner were made before pushing it to GitHub. To make sure the code runs, the code was also tested on other devices. Test cases are built to outline procedures that would be used to make sure the code was working and met the requirements, which led to further improvement of the code.
