Project (Website) TextBuddy:

TextBuddy is a website for College Students who might not be able to afford new textbooks, need support in class,
and want a community where they can discuss homework and receive help.

This platform provides students with connections to others with similar needs in a place that allows students to
receive and give help through class forums.

Unlike Craigslist, TextBuddy is geared specifically towards students to meet their similar financial and academic needs.

TextBuddy includes a listings page where students can post listings for selling textbooks or notebooks and other students
can find what recources are accessible and up for sale.

This website also provides a Forum page in which customers can post and reply to discussion posts so that they can converse
with their classmates about difficult topics or course material.
